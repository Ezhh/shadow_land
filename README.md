Shadow Lands
===

Minetest biome mod by Shara RedCat.

NOTE: This mod is not yet complete. Do not use this for anything other than testing purposes until this note is removed.

The Shadow Lands biome appears close to snowy grassland and cold deserts. Its most distinctive feature is that no matter the time of day when you enter, for so long as you remain in the Shadow Lands the sun will not shine for you.

More details to come at a later date.
